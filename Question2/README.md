Aim: Analyzing students' performance based on various factors.

Abstract:

This dataset contains information about students' grades across different subject areas, including math, reading, and writing scores. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand how various factors, such as test-taking strategies, parental background, and gender, influence students' academic performance.

To provide a thorough analysis, I have utilized 5 different visualizations—Violin Plot, Heatmap, Joint Plot, Box Plot, and PairGrid—to explore different aspects of the data. These visualizations help in identifying patterns, relationships, and correlations between variables that contribute to student outcomes. The analysis is structured across three stages of reproducible workflow to ensure the process is methodologically sound, transparent, and easy to follow.
