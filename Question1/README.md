Aim:
The objective of this analysis is to explore factors contributing to frailty, focusing on variables such as grip strength, age, weight, and height. By examining these factors, the aim is to understand how they influence physical weakness and overall frailty.

Abstract:
This analysis delves into frailty data to gain insights into the physical vulnerabilities across a range of individuals. Specifically, the focus is on evaluating the relationship between grip strength, age, weight, and height, and how these factors contribute to physical weakness or frailty.

Using Python, I conducted an extensive statistical analysis that includes various visualizations to enhance understanding. Among these, I have incorporated scatter plots, box plots, bar plots, KDE plots, and swarm plots to provide a clear and comprehensive visualization of the data. The scatter plot shows relationships between continuous variables such as height and weight, while the box plot highlights grip strength differences across frailty groups. 

Additionally, the analysis includes a heatmap to visualize correlations and a KDE plot to represent age distribution. These visualizations facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the data, helping identify trends and potential areas for further investigation.
